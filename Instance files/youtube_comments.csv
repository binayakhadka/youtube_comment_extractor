James Jewett,"Honestly, I was not a fan of the Urus before you started this build. I mean, you don't by a Lambo to by an SUV. But, watching this build; it has grown on me. I think you guys made the car look even better than how it looked from factory, paining the lower trim black and all of the other black accent with the other trim peices. I am really digging how it looks now. The effort you guys put into your builds and your content that you put out, easily makes your channel my favorite on YouTube.",9,2023-09-01T15:20:23Z,2023-09-01T15:20:59Z

tazfaninafocus,"A phenomenal car. You guys played all the right notes to get it to where it is. One of my favorites for sure. I was a little saddened when you decided to wrap it initially, but you came good.
The skills you have picked up for painting are starting to really shine (pun intended), and it will only get better now you have your own booth.
You have come a long way, and I hope you are proud of what you have achieved.
You do need to get back to your roots though I think. You have become too money-hungry for me. You were a better channel when you just did honest-to-goodness builds like the army truck and the Mustang/Camaro etc. Does your sky buddy not have something to say about greed or some such?
I hope this is the car that gets you banned from driving though, I really do.
I cannot think of another lesson you would learn from. I mean, getting stopped by Police several times has not taught you anything, so hopefully a ban will.
What would your imaginary friend say if you asked him if you drove in a manner that was considerate to the laws and to other people?",3,2023-09-01T13:38:17Z,2023-09-01T13:38:17Z

RagingBlade1,"Great work and best decision to get rid of the wrap, I thought it looked ugly (however taste is something personal so not going to argue with anyone over it).  

I did notice a little oil leak under the military truck, or was that just my eyes deceiving me.

Keep up the good work and carry on expanding your suite of merchandising but don't compromise on quality, if you find your product is as good as you want it to be, change it to improve.  People will buy if you commit to the quality standard and being down to earth as you have been.  Love the fact that you bring in your family and friends to share your success with them.  Haven't seen mama Goonzquad for a while, hope all is well and GOD BLESS, UK",1,2023-09-01T08:48:23Z,2023-09-01T08:48:23Z

Bob Nevitt,"Whilst i find the re-builds that you do interesting and i admire your skills, i'm amazed that you are able to take an unregistered, just rebuilt vehicle without a DOT test on the public highway, with the added issue that you were towing a trailer without any lights or indicators etc! What would happen if you were involved in an accident, are you even insured? This would be totally unacceptable here in the UK, the police would have pulled you over and probably siezed the vehicle and prosecuted you, even maybe losing your licence to drive!
Personally i believe it is foolhardy of you to do this and does not set a good example to other road users?",0,2023-09-01T07:13:32Z,2023-09-01T07:13:32Z
cADIc,"Hi guys. I have a suggestion for you. Please consider buying some land and making your own circuit, drag and everything you need to test the cars when they are ready. Also, you are safe there and don't worry about the cops. I am convinced that it is possible for you and from my point of view it would be completely your business. Repair shop, paint shop, test circuit.
